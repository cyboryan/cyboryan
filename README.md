### Hi there! I'm Xyber Pastoril 👋

A Computer Science Undergraduate at Visayas State University in the Philippines. A student who's willing to learn and develop applications that may help make work easier and productive.

- 🏫 I'm currently learning Event Driven Programming (C#), the concepts of Laravel Framework v8 (PHP), and more based on our curriculum.
- 💻 I'm currently working on my own version of a Pomodoro App running in c# and a side-project running on Laravel Framework v8 that will be featured soon.
- 📧 How to reach me? You may send me an email at xyber.pastoril@protonmail.com. Allow me up to a day to respond.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was once called a Math Whiz before committing myself fully into tech. Right now, I've been called a Computer Whiz in our district (barangay in PH).
- ⚡ Fun fact # 2: I'm also into graphics, video editing, livestreaming events, or perhaps, learning more about technology, especially when I'm bored.

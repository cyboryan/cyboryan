### Hi there! I'm Xyber Pastoril 👋

A Computer Science Undergraduate at Visayas State University in the Philippines. I'm committed to develop applications that make some work easier on the community through the aid of web development.

- 🏫 I'm currently learning the MVC Framework for PHP after a semester-long hiatus on web development.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was once called a Math Whiz before committing myself fully into tech.
- ⚡ Fun fact # 2: I'm also into graphics, video editing, livestreaming events if I'm bored.
